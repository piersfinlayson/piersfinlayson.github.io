Learn how to access microprocessor ROM functions directly from within your Rust code, and understand what approach Raspberry Pi took to make their ROM functions accessible from your applications.  

In this episode I demonstrate how ROM functions are locatable and callable on different micro-processors, including the ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi's RP2040, from within Rust.  While this topic is at a much lower level than most programmers get involved with, I've covered it in a simple, clear and approachable way so it should make sense to those with basic programming knowledge.  

This video covers:  
- Why you might want to access ROM functions directly - for performance, efficiency or to access low-level hardware capabilities  
- How ROM functions are stored and located on the ESP8266 - using a static linker map file  
- How ROM functions are stored and located on the RP2040 (the processor used in the Raspberry Pi Pico) - dynamically, using code and lookup tables located in the ROM  
- Accessing and calling RP2040 ROM functions within embedded Rust code  
- Why Raspberry Pi's solution is the most elegant I've seen, providing great usability and maintainability  

If you want to programmatically cause your RP2040/Pico to enter DFU mode from Rust, check out my rp2040-rom crate: <https://crates.io/crates/rp2040-rom>
