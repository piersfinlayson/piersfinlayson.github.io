🛠️ In this video, I demonstrate how to use a 6502 processor as a replacement for the harder-to-find 6504 in Commodore IEEE-488 disk drives like the 2040, 3040, and 4040 series.  

💡 If your 6504 fails, this solution could save your drive from becoming an enormous and over-the-top paperweight.  

What's in the video:  
* 🧩 Comparison of 6502 vs 6504 pinouts and specifications  
* 📋 Explanation of the key differences between these processors  
* 📝 Schematic for the conversion solution  
* 🔍 Close-up look at the adapter  
* 🧪 Testing the solution on my recently repaired 3040 drive  

If you're having problems with a 2040/3040/4040 disk drive, check out my new diagnostics ROM:
