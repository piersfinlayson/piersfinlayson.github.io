I accidentally left my Commodore 2031 disk drive on overnight, and now it won't boot.  Watch as I fumble around and eventually manage to repair it.  

I left it on overnight ... and now it won't boot - Commodore 2031/1541 repair - floppies rock ep18  

In this episode, I take another look at my 2031 IEEE-488 disk drive, in which I rewound the spindle motor tachometer in a previous episode.  This time around the drive won't even boot, because I left it on overnight, and presumably a component failed due to the heat.  In the process of fixing the drive you'll even see me make the problem worse than it was, before fixing it.

Problems:  
* The static RAM chip (TMM2016) had failed.  I replaced it  
* While working on the drive I broke my 2031 ROMs, due to a poor design of my ROM replacement boards.  I resoldered the damaged parts.
