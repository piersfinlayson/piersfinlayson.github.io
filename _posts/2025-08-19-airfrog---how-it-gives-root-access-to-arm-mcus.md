Airfrog is a coin-sized wireless co-processor that gives you god-mode access to ARM MCUs over WiFi.  In this video I explain how it adds processing power to the MCU, reprograms flash memory while the target continues running, extracts telemetry from systems with no spare processing cycles, and provides remote debugging capabilities without physical access to the target device.
