I upgraded my Commodore IEEE-488 disk drive diagnostics ROM with new features - it now helps identify both digital and mechanical failures in these classic CBM drives.  

🔗 GitHub: <https://piers.rocks/u/ieeedr>  

✨ New Capabilities:  

- 🧪 Diagnoses digital PCB component failures  
- 📊 Reports results via LEDs and IEEE-488 interface  
- 💻 Includes PC and PET companion software  
- 🔄 Controls spindle/stepper motors for mechanical diagnostics  
- 💾 Supports 2040/3040/4040 - may also support 8050/8250 (currently untested)
