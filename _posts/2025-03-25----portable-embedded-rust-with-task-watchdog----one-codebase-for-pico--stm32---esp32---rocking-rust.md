Learn how to build robust embedded applications using Rust, Embassy, and my new task-watchdog crate - a flexible watchdog management library that multiplexes task watchdogs into a single hardware watchdog timer!  

In this two-for-one video, I demonstrate how to write truly portable embedded code that works across multiple microcontroller platforms (Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico 2, STM32, and ESP32) using the same codebase, while showcasing my new task-watchdog crate for managing system reliability.  

This video covers:  

- üõ°Ô∏è Understanding watchdogs and why they're critical for embedded system reliability  
- üîÄ How task-watchdog multiplexes multiple task watchdogs into a single hardware watchdog  
- üíª Writing portable Rust code that works across Pico, Pico 2, STM32, and ESP32  
- ‚ö° Using Embassy for async Rust on embedded systems  
- üß† Building a complete multi-task application with proper watchdog integration  
- üîå Dynamic task management with runtime registration/deregistration  
- üö´ Demonstrating fault recovery with intentional task failures  

I start with a basic example showing the core API, then expand to a more comprehensive example that supports all target platforms in a single file, demonstrating the true portability of both task-watchdog and Embassy-based embedded Rust.  

Whether you're building mission-critical embedded systems or just want to make your projects more robust, this video will show you how to implement proper watchdog management across multiple platforms with a single, clean codebase.

I didn't cover the full task-watchdog API in the video, so check out the crate documentation below if you're interested.  In particular there's also a task_deregister() call, which allows tasks to block without the watchdog being triggered.
