Learn how to implement a vendor-specific USB device in Rust with ease.  

In this episode I use Rust to develop an embedded USB vendor device on the Pico.  This uses Rust's async and futures support, and provides a simple but complete example implementing control and bulk transfers, following a subset of the protocol used by the xum1541 project (part of OpenCBM).  

My previous video covered a functionally identical example in C using the TinyUSB Stack and Pico SDK. It is here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_c9s5aC1No>  

This tutorial covers:  
- Setting up a basic USB vendor device  
- Implementing USB descriptors  
- Handling static lifetimes  
- Handling control and bulk transfers  
- Using embassy's task executor  
- A watchdog timer  
- Mutexes  
- Comparisons between the TinyUSB stack and embassy  
- Lots of other stuff!  

As well as the Pico (Rp2040 and RP2350) embassy supports the ESP32, STM32 and Nordic devices.

This example is perfect for anyone wanting to:  
- Learn USB device development with Rust  
- Create custom USB peripherals with Rust  
- Understand low-level USB communication  
- Get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico with  Rust  

Prerequisites:  
- Basic familiarity with Rust programming  
- 2 x Raspberry Pi Picos (one for use as a debug probe)  
- Development environment set up for Rust - although full instructions for building and flashing the example are in the project.
