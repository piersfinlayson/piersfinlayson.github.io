In this video I demonstrate the new features in v0.2.0 of the Software Defined Retro ROM - the most flexible ROM replacement for 8-bit computers - including the ability for a **single replacement ROM to emulate multiple original ROMs**.  

I demonstrate replacing both kernal ROMs in a fine, old 1541 disk drive, kernal and basic ROMs in a VIC-20, and the kernal, basic and character ROMs on a C64.  

**What's covered:**  
• How it works and how to configure it  
• Current limitations and future plans  
• New status LED functionality  
• Logging support  
• Dynamic pin mapping for custom PCB designs  
• Firmware inspection tool
