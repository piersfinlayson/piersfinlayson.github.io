This week I've added support for automatically switching ROM images in a running system to the software defined retro ROM.  

I demonstrate this by switching between different character ROMs on the C64 and VIC-20, without impacting the host.  

This same feature can be used to **rewrite** the ROM image while the software ROM keeps running and serving bytes.
