In this episode, I'm adding device ID switches and reset buttons to my 45-year-old Commodore 2040 disk drive - because sometimes old hardware needs some improvements.  

Unlike the later IEC drives that locked you into device 8-11, the IEEE-488 drives were designed for large multi-device setups with configurable IDs 8-15. I'm making those jumper settings easily accessible with switches, plus adding both drive-specific and bus-wide reset functionality.  

You'll see the complete process: case modification, schematic analysis, trace cutting, and the satisfying moment when everything works as intended.
