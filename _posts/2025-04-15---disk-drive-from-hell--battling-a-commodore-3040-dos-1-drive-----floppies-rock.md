🛠️ In this video, I tackle the repair of a seriously problematic Commodore 3040 disk drive that earned its nickname "Disk Drive From Hell" through a tortuous diagnostic and repair journey.  

💡 Join me as I get my hands dirty with some serious troubleshooting.  

What's in the video:  
* 📚 Brief overview of Commodore's early disk drive lineup  
* 🧩 Overview of the 3040's architecture and components  
* 🔍 Step-by-step diagnosis of multiple failures  
* 🔎 Using my new 2040/3040/4040 diagnostics ROM  
* 💾 Replacing a failed 2114 static RAM chip  
* 🔌 Replacing out a dead 5632 RIOT chip  
* 💻 Installing a replacement ROM  
* 😱 How I accidentally shorted the address and data buses together  
* 🛠️ Repairing self-inflicted damage to two 74LS157 chips  
* 🎉 When it finally boots and runs  

This repair used my new diagnostic ROM that I developed specifically for these vintage Commodore IEEE drives.  If you're working on similar drives, check it out here:

💾 Stay tuned for a follow-up episode where I'll service the actual drive mechanisms to get this big boy fully operational, and me tackling my other IEEE-488 drives.
