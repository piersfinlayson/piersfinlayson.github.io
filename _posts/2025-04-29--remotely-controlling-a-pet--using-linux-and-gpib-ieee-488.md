This week I got distracted an implemented a remote control for the Commodore PET, driving it via GPIB (IEEE-488) and a Linux PC.  

Using this you can upload BASIC programs and machine code to the PET 4x faster than using a disk drive, and launch them without touching the PET.  

This allows you to:  
- streamline development workflows with a real PET (you can modify your code on a PC, and then upload and execute it immediately when you're ready)  
- getting programs onto your PET quickly if you don't have a working disk drive (for example, to load a utility to help you diagnose problems with a drive)  
- control multiple PETs simultaneously, launching the same code within a few microseconds.  

You'll need an xum1541/ZoomFloppy/pico1541 with GPIB/IEEE-488 support to connect your PET to your PC.
