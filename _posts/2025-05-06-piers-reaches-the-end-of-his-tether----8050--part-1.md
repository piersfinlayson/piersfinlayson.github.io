This week I try to get my new Commodore IEEE-488 drive diagnostics ROM working in my 8050 drive.  Try being the operative word.  

This leads to a deep dive into the schematics and identification of two schematic errors, and the use of unusual 2364s in the (or, at least my) 8050.  

This is the _correct_ schematic: <http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/drives/old/8050/8050-25.gif>  
This is the _incorect_ schematic: <http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/drives/old/8050/8050_schematics.pdf>  

You can find the diagnostics ROM here: <https://github.com/piersfinlayson/cbm-ieee-disk-diag-rom>
