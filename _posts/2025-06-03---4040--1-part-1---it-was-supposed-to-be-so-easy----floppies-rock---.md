This week I tackle a new (to me) Commodore 4040 disk drive which won't boot 💀.  I hunt down the culprit preventing it from booting, and deep dive into a disassembly of the secondary processor's startup ROM code. 🔍⚡  

As well as tracking down the problem causing it to fail to boot, I run through a disassembly of the secondary processor's ROM startup ROM.  

📚 Building my library of IEEE-488 drive ROM disassemblies at: <https://github.com/piersfinlayson/cbm-ieee-disk-diag-rom>  
Check the docs/original_roms folder - branch 0.2.2 has the latest disassemblies!
