⚡ Pushing the STM32F103 to its limits! In this video I show you how to achieve the maximum clock speeds - both officially supported and unsupported - on these microcontrollers.  

🔍 I break down the clock tree from the RM0008 reference manual, then dive into direct register manipulation using C and assembly. Watch real-world demos comparing different clock configurations and discover whether Flash or RAM delivers better performance at extreme frequencies. Plus, meet the FCM32F103 clone and see how it stacks up.
