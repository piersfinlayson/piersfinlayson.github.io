Piers has more than 30 years experience as a professional software engineer, working on highly available and reliable telephony systems.  Many of those are in daily worldwide use handling billions of calls and texts.  He was most recently employed by Microsoft as a Partner Software Engineering Manager.

He now spends much of his time learning about hardware and software technologies, both new and old, and vlogging about it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@piers_rocks).

He is the author of several open source software and hardware projects including:
- [One ROM](https://piers.rocks/u/one) - the most flexible retro ROM replacement for vintage systems, using RP2350 and STM32 micro-controllers
- [Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog) - a tiny wireless co-processor, programmer and debugger for ARM MCUs, implemented on an ESP32
